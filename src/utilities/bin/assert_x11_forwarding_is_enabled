In order to launch some graphical applications from the commandline through ssh, you need to enable 'X11 forwarding'.
This can be done with the ssh options '-X' or '-Y'. For example: 'ssh sts271@eccc-ppp4 -X'
You may need to 'exit' this ssh session, reconnect with that option, and try running this command again."
