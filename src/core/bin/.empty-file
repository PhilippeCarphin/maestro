# This file exists so that git stores the bin directory in the repo.
# This is necessary because many makes in the makefile assume the bin directory exists.
# If you run for example:
#    make maestro
# it would also run:
#    mv maestro bin
# which renames maestro to bin, since bin does not exist.

# If you can think of a cleaner, simpler way, go ahead!
