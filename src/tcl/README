tcl is part of the Maestro sequencer software package.
This is simply a packaging of tcl-tk 8.5.11 and required extensions for use within the maestro GUIs.
The tcl core source material was not modified in any significant way.

Before 2018, the tcl packages used by Maestro were stored as tars and extracted for the compile.
The folders here are simply the contents of those tars. This allowed for some cleanup of the build process.

The tcl package is not meant to be published through ssm, only installed.
Some of the tcl executables may clash with system executables.
