# Eventually, an experiment for testing should be packaged with the maestro
# source.

# This test serves to test and document the interaction between the maestro
# executable ${NAME_COMING_SOON} and the TCL part that will read the output of
# ${NAME_COMING_SOON} into a tsv::keyed_list.
#
# This test should be run to check validity of changes to the maestro
# executable.  If any changes are made that make this test fail, either there
# was an error in the change, or this test should be updated to stay valid.
#
# If this is done errors will be caught faster, their source will be easier to
# find and if the test passes, we have more confidence that we're all good.
#
# If the TCL portion is modified and expects to use the list differently, this
# test should be modified to reflect this, then the maestro portion should be
# modified to make the test pass.
