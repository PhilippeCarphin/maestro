[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Maestro/folders/hub)



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w015](#w015): Git repo has uncommited changes

There are uncommited changes in the git repo. Experiments with the '{context}' context should always have nothing to commit and a clean working tree from 'git status'.



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w016](#w016): The task run_orji is disabled

The task resource '{resource_path}' has a catchup value of '{catchup}' but 'run_orji' tasks should always be enabled. This way, users get to decide whether to subscribe or unsubscribe.


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/orji)



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w017](#w017): Archive file is not a link

[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Archive)



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w018](#w018): Bad items in gitignore

The gitignore file '{gitignore_path}' should not contain line '{line}'. It's important that this pattern is in the git repository so a full working suite can be shared.



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w019](#w019): Missing items in gitignore

The gitignore file '{gitignore_path}' should contain {content}. This will ignore files generated when running this suite which do not belong in the version controlled project.



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w020](#w020): No gitignore

There should be a gitignore file here: '{gitignore_path}'. No gitignore means large amounts of unimportant files may be accidentally shared or added to the project.



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w021](#w021): Maestro file in $CMCCONST

The realpath for file '{path}' is in the $CMCCONST folder '{cmcconst}'. Task, config, flow, and resource XML files used in a suite should not be in the $CMCCONST folder.


[More info](https://gitlab.science.gc.ca/CMOI/best-practices/blob/master/en/constants.md)



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w022](#w022): Machine resource is hard coded

The experiment seems to have the '{context}' context but the value '{machine_value}' of 'machine' in '{resource_path}' is hard coded. A switchover may break this suite. Use a variable like $FRONTEND instead.



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w023](#w023): Operational user can overwrite experiment

The operational user '{user}' has write permissions on the permanent project file '{path}'. For safety during operational runs, '{user}' should only have read and execution permissions for permanent project files.

[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/CMOI/Suite_Management_Process)



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w026](#w026): Wallclock much bigger than history requires

The wallclock for '{node_path}' is set to '{wallclock_seconds}' seconds in '{resource_xml}' but the latest successful run on '{datestamp}' only took '{latest_seconds}' seconds. This is {factor} times bigger (the threshold for this message is {threshold}). The wallclock should probably be lowered.


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Wallclock)



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w027](#w027): Clobbered SSM packages

Different versions of the SSM package '{package}' are used: {versions}. The same version should be used by all, or the package should only be added to the environment in one root place. Files:\n{paths}


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Ssm)



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w028](#w028): Suite path in resources without datestamp

The resource file '{resource_path}' has generic references to maestro project paths which don't use datestamps like '_20200401'. This may cause issues with troubleshooting, history, and transfers. Paths:\n{bad}


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/CMOI/Suite_Management_Process)



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w029](#w029): No soft link on operational home

[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/CMOI/Suite_Management_Process)



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w030](#w030): Deprecated uspmadt system

The '-r' or '-t' options used in '{path}' with 'fname', 'fgen+', or 'dtstmp' should not be a 'run' variable. This uses the deprecated uspmadt system. Use 'CMCSTAMP' instead. Lines:\n{lines}


[More info](https://gitlab.science.gc.ca/CMOI-Service-Desk/General/issues/5)



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w031](#w031): Missing required variables in resources.def

The file '{resource_path}' describes an experiment '{exp}' which does not exist, or is broken. Maestro might ignore this dependency.



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

### [w036](#w036): No archiving in hub

The 'hub' folder seems to have subfolders containing more than {file_count} files from more than {day_count} days but no '.protocole_*' archiving file. These files may accumulate:\n{folders}



![color w image](../color-warning.png)

# Level: Info
![color i image](../color-info.png)

### [i001](#i001): Multiple homes for project

The maestro experiment is found in the home folder '{real_home}' but core maestro files are soft links to other user homes. This may be unstable. Links:\n{bad_links}


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/User:Maciaa/home_references)



![color i image](../color-info.png)

### [i002](#i002): Module name and path differ

The module folder '{folder_name}' differs from the module name '{attribute_name}' in the flow XML '{xml_path}'. This can help organize a project, but it may also be confusing.



![color i image](../color-info.png)

### [i003](#i003): Text editor swap files

Text editor swap files were found, for example for vim or emacs. If your editor is closed, you may want to recover or delete these:\n{swaps}

[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Nodelogger)



![color i image](../color-info.png)

### [i006](#i006): Lead developers from git history

Based on the git history for this project (commit frequency, recency, continuity) these seem to be the lead developers:\n{developers}



![color i image](../color-info.png)

### [i007](#i007): Absolute developer paths

The file '{path}' contains absolute paths to a non-operational user's home. This cannot be installed operationally:\n{bad}



![color i image](../color-info.png)

### [i008](#i008): Old SSM version

The file '{path}' uses an SSM package '{old}' but a newer version '{new}' is available.


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Ssm)



![color i image](../color-info.png)

### [i009](#i009): Resources with valid hours

# Level: Best practice
![color b image](../color-best-practice.png)

### [b001](#b001): Hard coded dependency path

The 'exp' attribute '{exp_value}' in the resources file '{resource_path}' is hard coded. This is less portable and more fragile. Consider using a variable instead.



![color b image](../color-best-practice.png)

### [b002](#b002): SupportInfo is too long

The SupportInfo attribute in the XML '{xml_path}' is '{char_count}' characters long but it should be shorter. The recommended maximum is {max_chars} characters.


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Maestro/ExpOptions.xml)



![color b image](../color-best-practice.png)

### [b003](#b003): SupportInfo has no URL

The SupportInfo attribute in the XML '{xml_path}' should contain a URL. This is the recommended way to provide detailed support status info and troubleshooting steps.


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Maestro/ExpOptions.xml)



![color b image](../color-best-practice.png)

### [b004](#b004): Non-standard SupportInfo text

The SupportInfo attribute in the XML '{xml_path}' should start with a value like 'Full Support'. Recommended start strings:\n{substrings}


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Maestro/ExpOptions.xml)



![color b image](../color-best-practice.png)

### [b005](#b005): Deprecated file or folder

The use of file or folder '{path}' is deprecated and should be deleted.



![color b image](../color-best-practice.png)

### [b006](#b006): Non-maestro files in maestro folders

The maestro folder '{folder}' should only contain maestro files like tsk, cfg, xml. These files were found:\n{filenames}


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Maestro_Files_and_Folders)



![color b image](../color-best-practice.png)

### [b007](#b007): Comments in config file

The pseudo-xml section (containing input, executables, and output) of the config file '{file_path}' contains {count} commented lines starting with "##". These seem to be configuration lines and not comments, and should be removed.


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Maestro/.cfg)



![color b image](../color-best-practice.png)

### [b008](#b008): Hidden queue alias used

The value '{value}' for the resource variable '{name}' is a hidden queue alias not easily visible in qstat. Consider using one of these queues instead:\n{queues}



![color b image](../color-best-practice.png)

### [b009](#b009): Deprecated attribute in SUBMITS element

The file '{xml_path}' has the attribute 'type' in a SUBMITS element. This is deprecated and can be removed.


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Maestro/SUBMITS)



![color b image](../color-best-practice.png)

### [b010](#b010): Non-standard characters in executable name

The file '{bad}' is a deprecated archive file and should be deleted. If the hub has no other archive files, its archiving status should be examined.


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Archive)



![color b image](../color-best-practice.png)

### [b013](#b013): Unclear folder name

The folder '{unclear}' should have a descriptive soft link next to it. For example 'forecast -> e1'. This gives newbies one less thing to memorize when getting started.


[More info](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Obfuscation)



![color b image](../color-best-practice.png)
