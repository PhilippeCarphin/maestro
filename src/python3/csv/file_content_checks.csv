# This is a tab delimited spreadsheet (TSV) for all codes associate to file content.				
# The ‘filetypes’ is a comma delimited list of what file types to search: all, tsk, cfg, xml, resource_xml				
# If ‘substring’ is found in a file, or the regex matches its content, heimdall produces the scanner code.				
# Anything more complicated probably deserves its own Python function.
