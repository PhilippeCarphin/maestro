code	label	description	url	notes
b1	Hard coded dependency path	The ‘exp’ attribute ‘{exp_value}’ in the resources file ‘{resource_path}’ is hard coded. This is less portable and more fragile. Consider using a variable instead.		
c1	No EntryModule	EntryModule link does not exist: ‘{entry_module}’	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/EntryModule	
c2	Bad EntryModule	EntryModule is not a link: ‘{entry_module}’	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/EntryModule	
c3	No experiment here	Could not find an experiment for path: '{path}'. A valid experiment folder contains an 'EntryModule' link.	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/EntryModule	
c4	No EntryModule flow.xml	The required EntryModule flow.xml file does not exist: ‘{flow_xml}’	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/EntryModule	
c5	Bad EntryModule flow.xml	The required EntryModule flow.xml file failed to parse as XML: ‘{flow_xml}’		
e1	Missing suite folders	All suites require the folders: ‘listings’, ‘sequencing’, ‘stats’, and ‘logs’. This suite is missing: {folders}	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Maestro_Files_and_Folders	
e10	Hard coded path in config file	The path ‘{bad_path}’ defined in ‘{config_path}’ is absolute and does not start with a variable like ‘${{SEQ_EXP_HOME}}’. This is a less portable and more fragile way to configure an experiment.		
e11	Dependency experiment does not exist	The ‘exp’ attribute ‘{exp_value}’ in the resources file ‘{resource_path}’ is not a path to a folder that exists.		
e12	Undefined resource XML variables	The resource XML ‘{resource_path}’ uses variables that are not defined in any resource files like ‘resources/resources.def’. Variables: {variable_names}		
e2	Bad XML	Failed to parse XML: ‘{xml}’		
e3	Bad task name	Invalid task name ‘{task_name}’ at path '{task_path}’		
e4	Broken symlink	Soft links were found with targets that do not exist:\n{broken_links}		
e5	Scattered module flow	The flow XML children for module ‘{module_name}’ are defined in more than one flow XML:\n{flow_xmls}	https://gitlab.science.gc.ca/CMOI/mflow-prototype/issues/23#note_189290	
e6	Bad nodelogger signal	The executable ‘nodelogger’ was given a bad signal ‘{bad_signal}’ for its ‘-s’ argument. Line {line_number} in: ‘{task_path}’	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Nodelogger	
e7	Missing required resource file	The task ‘{task_path}’ has no resource file at ‘{resource_path}’. This is required for the ‘{context}’ context.		
e8	Missing curly brackets in resource xml	Variables in resource XMLs must use curly brackets like ‘${{ABC}}’ not ‘$ABC’. The {search} was found in file: ‘{file_path}’		
e9	Unbalanced curly brackets in resource xml	Found an uneven number of curly brackets ‘{attribute_value}’ in a resource file: ‘{file_path}’		
i1	Multiple homes for project	The maestro experiment is found in the home folder ‘{real_home}’ but core maestro files are soft links to other user homes. This may be unstable and cannot be installed operationally. Links:\n{bad_links}		
w1	Missing resource file	The task ‘{task_path}’ has no resource file at ‘{resource_path}’. Create a resource file to avoid using unknown defaults.		
w2	Missing loop resource file	The loop ‘{node_path}’ has no resource file at ‘{resource_path}’. Create a resource file to avoid using unknown defaults.		
w3	Deprecated site1/site2	The paths site1 and site2 are no longer available after the upgrades in early 2020. The {search} was found in file: ‘{file_path}’		
w4	Deprecated hall1/hall2	The paths hall1 and hall2 are no longer available after the upgrades in early 2020. The {search} was found in file: ‘{file_path}’		
w5	Multiple homes for project	The maestro experiment is found in the home folder ‘{real_home}’ but core maestro files are soft links to other user homes. This may be unstable and cannot be installed operationally. Links:\n{bad_links}		
w6	Hard coded path in config file	The path ‘{bad_path}’ defined in ‘{config_path}’ is absolute and does not start with a variable like ‘${{SEQ_EXP_HOME}}’. This is a less portable and more fragile way to configure an experiment.		
b2	SupportInfo is too long	The SupportInfo attribute in the XML ‘{xml_path}’ is ‘{char_count}’ but it should be shorter. The recommended maximum is {max_chars}. characters.		
b3	SupportInfo has no URL	The SupportInfo attribute in the XML ‘{xml_path}’ should contain a URL. This is the recommended way to provide detailed support status info and troubleshooting steps.		
b4	SupportInfo missing standard substring	The SupportInfo attribute in the XML ‘{xml_path}’ should start with a value like ‘Full Support’. Recommended start strings: {substrings}		
w7	No support status in operational experiment	There is no SupportInfo attribute in the XML ‘{xml_path}’ or the XML does not exist. This is required for operational experiments.		
w8	Multiple support statuses	The XML ‘{xml_path}’ has more than one SupportInfo element.		
w9	Resource variable typo	The resource variable ‘{maybe_typo}’ is defined but the standard variable name ‘{expected}’ is not. Did you mean that instead?	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/User:Lims/projects/tech_transfer_improvements#Using_standard_variables_for_machine_and_queue_definitions	
w10	Bad queue value for resource variable	The value ‘{value}’ for the resource variable ‘{name}’ is not a queue available in qstat. Queues: {queues}		
w11	Experiment not in overview XML	The experiment seems to have the ‘{context}’ context but it was not found in the {exp_count} experiments in the overview XML: {xml_path}		
w12	Experiment in unexpected overview XML	The experiment seems to have the ‘{context}’ context but it was found in the {exp_count} experiments in the ‘{xml_context}’ context overview XML: {xml_path}		
e13	Dissemination state does not match context	The experiment seems to have the ‘{context}’ context but variables in ‘{cfg_path}’ do not match what is expected: {unexpected}		
w13	Misplaced dissemination variables	The variables {variables} belong only in ‘experiment.cfg’ files but were found in: ‘{cfg_path}’		
b5	Deprecated files and folders	These files or folders are deprecated and should be deleted: {deprecated}		
e14	Non-links in hub	Experiments with the ‘{context}’ context can only have soft link folders in their ‘hub’ folder. Bad: {bad}		
w14	Hub pairs have dissimilar targets	The hub folder links ‘{folder1}’ and ‘{folder2}’ are expected to have similar targets. Instead they are very different:\n{target1}\n{target2}		
i2	Module name and path differ	The module folder ‘{folder_name}’ differs from the module name ‘{attribute_name}’ in the flow XML ‘{xml_path}’. This can help organize a project, but it may also be confusing.		
b6	Non-maestro files in maestro folders	The maestro folder ‘{folder}’ should only contain maestro files like tsk, cfg, xml. These files were found: {filenames}
