code	label	description	url	notes
b001	Hard coded dependency path	The ‘exp’ attribute ‘{exp_value}’ in the resources file ‘{resource_path}’ is hard coded. This is less portable and more fragile. Consider using a variable instead.		
b002	SupportInfo is too long	The SupportInfo attribute in the XML ‘{xml_path}’ is ‘{char_count}’ characters long but it should be shorter. The recommended maximum is {max_chars}. characters.		
b003	SupportInfo has no URL	The SupportInfo attribute in the XML ‘{xml_path}’ should contain a URL. This is the recommended way to provide detailed support status info and troubleshooting steps.		
b004	SupportInfo missing standard substring	The SupportInfo attribute in the XML ‘{xml_path}’ should start with a value like ‘Full Support’. Recommended start strings:\n{substrings}		
b005	Deprecated file or folder	The file or folder ‘{path}’ is deprecated and should be deleted.		
b006	Non-maestro files in maestro folders	The maestro folder ‘{folder}’ should only contain maestro files like tsk, cfg, xml. These files were found:\n{filenames}		
b007	Comments in config file	The pseudo-xml section (containing input, executables, and output) of the config file ‘{file_path}’ contains {count} commented lines starting with “##”. These seem to be configuration lines and not comments, and should be removed.		
b008	Hidden queue alias used	The value ‘{value}’ for the resource variable ‘{name}’ is a hidden queue alias not easily visible in qstat. Consider using one of these queues instead:\n{queues}		
c001	No EntryModule	EntryModule link does not exist: ‘{entry_module}’	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/EntryModule	
c002	Bad EntryModule	EntryModule is not a link: ‘{entry_module}’	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/EntryModule	
c003	No experiment here	Could not find an experiment for path: '{path}'. A valid experiment folder contains an 'EntryModule' link.	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/EntryModule	
c004	No EntryModule flow.xml	The required EntryModule flow.xml file does not exist: ‘{flow_xml}’	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/EntryModule	
c005	Bad EntryModule flow.xml	The required EntryModule flow.xml file failed to parse as XML: ‘{flow_xml}’		
e001	Missing suite folders	All suites require the folders: ‘listings’, ‘sequencing’, ‘stats’, and ‘logs’. This suite is missing: {folders}	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Maestro_Files_and_Folders	
e002	Bad XML	Failed to parse XML: ‘{xml}’		
e003	Invalid node name	Invalid node name ‘{node_name}’ in flow XML ‘{flow_path}’. Node names must be alphanumeric with dot, dash, or underscores. Must match the regex: {regex}	https://regex101.com/	
e004	Broken symlink	Soft links were found with targets that do not exist:\n{broken_links}		
e005	Scattered module flow	The flow XML children for module ‘{module_name}’ are defined in more than one flow XML:\n{flow_xmls}	https://gitlab.science.gc.ca/CMOI/mflow-prototype/issues/23#note_189290	
i005	Unknown nodelogger signal	The executable ‘nodelogger’ was given unknown signals for its ‘-s’ argument. This message won’t appear in the message center.\n{details}	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Nodelogger	
e007	Missing required resource file	The task ‘{task_path}’ has no resource file at ‘{resource_path}’. This is required for the ‘{context}’ context.		
e008	Missing curly brackets in resource xml	Variables in resource XMLs must use curly brackets like ‘${{ABC}}’ not ‘$ABC’. The file ‘{file_path}’ contains: ‘{matching_string}’		
e009	Unbalanced curly brackets in resource xml	Found an uneven number of curly brackets ‘{attribute_value}’ in a resource file: ‘{file_path}’		
e010	Hard coded path in config file	The path ‘{bad_path}’ defined in ‘{config_path}’ is absolute and does not start with a variable like ‘${{SEQ_EXP_HOME}}’. This is a less portable and more fragile way to configure an experiment.		
e011	Dependency experiment does not exist	The ‘exp’ attribute ‘{exp_value}’ in the resources file ‘{resource_path}’ is not a path to a folder that exists.		
e012	Undefined resource XML variables	The resource XML ‘{resource_path}’ uses variables that are not defined in any resource files like ‘resources/resources.def’. Variables:\n{variable_names}		
e013	Dissemination state does not match context	The experiment seems to have the ‘{context}’ context but variables in ‘{cfg_path}’ do not match what is expected: {unexpected}		
e014	Non-links in hub	Experiments with the ‘{context}’ context can only have soft link folders in their ‘hub’ folder:\n{bad}		
e015	Resource value higher than maximum	The resource value ‘{value}’ for ‘{attribute}’ in ‘{xml_path}’ is higher than the maximum of ‘{maximum}’ defined in jobctl-qstat for queue ‘{queue}’.		
e016	No git repo	There is no git repo tracking this experiment. Experiments with the ‘{context}’ context should always be version controlled with git.		
i001	Multiple homes for project	The maestro experiment is found in the home folder ‘{real_home}’ but core maestro files are soft links to other user homes. This may be unstable. Links:\n{bad_links}		
i002	Module name and path differ	The module folder ‘{folder_name}’ differs from the module name ‘{attribute_name}’ in the flow XML ‘{xml_path}’. This can help organize a project, but it may also be confusing.		
i003	Text editor swap files	Text editor swap files were found, for example for vim or emacs. If your editor is closed, you may want to recover or delete these:\n{swaps}		
i004	Git repo has uncommited changes	There are uncommited changes in the git repo.		
w001	Missing resource file	The task ‘{task_path}’ has no resource file at ‘{resource_path}’. Create a resource file to avoid using unknown defaults.		
w002	Missing loop resource file	The loop ‘{node_path}’ has no resource file at ‘{resource_path}’. Create a resource file to avoid using unknown defaults.		
w003	Deprecated site1/site2	The paths site1 and site2 are no longer available after the upgrades in early 2020. The file ‘{file_path}’ contains: ‘{matching_string}’		
w004	Deprecated hall1/hall2	The paths hall1 and hall2 are no longer available after the upgrades in early 2020. The file ‘{file_path}’ contains: ‘{matching_string}’		
w005	Multiple homes for project	The maestro experiment is found in the home folder ‘{real_home}’ but core maestro files are soft links to other user homes. This may be unstable and cannot be installed operationally. Links:\n{bad_links}		
w006	Hard coded path in config file	The path ‘{bad_path}’ defined in ‘{config_path}’ is absolute and does not start with a variable like ‘${{SEQ_EXP_HOME}}’. This is a less portable and more fragile way to configure an experiment.		
w007	No support status in operational experiment	There is no SupportInfo attribute in the XML ‘{xml_path}’ or the XML does not exist. This is required for operational experiments.		
w008	Multiple support statuses	The XML ‘{xml_path}’ has more than one SupportInfo element.		
w009	Resource variable typo	The resource variable ‘{maybe_typo}’ is defined but the standard variable name ‘{expected}’ is not. Did you mean that instead?	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/User:Lims/projects/tech_transfer_improvements#Using_standard_variables_for_machine_and_queue_definitions	
w010	Bad queue value for resource variable	The value ‘{value}’ for the resource variable ‘{name}’ is not a queue available in qstat. Queues:\n{queues}		
w011	Experiment not in overview XML	The experiment seems to have the ‘{context}’ context but it was not found in the {exp_count} experiments in the overview XML: {xml_path}		
w012	Experiment in unexpected overview XML	The experiment seems to have the ‘{context}’ context but it was found in the {exp_count} experiments in the ‘{xml_context}’ context overview XML: {xml_path}		
w013	Misplaced dissemination variables	The variables {variables} belong only in ‘experiment.cfg’ files but were found in: ‘{cfg_path}’		
w014	Hub pairs have dissimilar targets	The hub folder links ‘{folder1}’ and ‘{folder2}’ are expected to have similar targets. Instead they are very different:\n{target1}\n{target2}		
w015	Git repo has uncommited changes	There are uncommited changes in the git repo. Experiments with the ‘{context}’ context should always have nothing to commit and a clean working tree from ‘git status’.		
b009	Deprecated attribute in SUBMITS element	The attribute ‘type’ in <SUBMITS> elements is deprecated and can be removed. Found in files:\n{xml_paths}		
b010	Non-standard characters in executable name	Executable names have non-standard characters that do not match regex ‘{regex}’. This can cause bugs with tools, operating systems, and parsers. Consider renaming them:\n{details}	https://regex101.com/	
b011	Top-level file or folder in CMCCONST	There are references to files or folders in the root level of the CMCCONST folder. It is recommended instead to use folders in CMCCONST instead. The file ‘{file_path}’ contains: ‘{matching_string}’	https://gitlab.science.gc.ca/CMOI/best-practices/blob/master/en/constants.md	
i006	Lead developers from git history	Based on the git history for this project (commit frequency, recency, continuity) these seem to be the lead developers:\n{developers}		
w016	The task run_orji is disabled	The task resource ‘{resource_path}’ has a catchup value of ‘{catchup}’ but ‘run_orji’ tasks should always be enabled. This way, users get to decide whether to subscribe or unsubscribe.	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/orji	
w017	Archive file is not a link	The archive file ‘{bad}’ is not a link. Files named ‘.protocole_*’ or ‘.archive_monitor_*’ must be links so that the maintainers of the archive system can more easily manage its settings.		
b012	Deprecated archive file	The file ‘{bad}’ is a deprecated archive file and should be deleted. If the hub has no other archive files, its archiving status should be examined.		
w018	Bad items in gitignore	The gitignore file ‘{gitignore_path}’ should not contain line ‘{line}’. It’s important that this pattern is in the git repository so a full working suite can be shared.		
w019	Missing items in gitignore	The gitignore file ‘{gitignore_path}’ should contain {content}. This will ignore files generated when running this suite which do not belong in the version controlled project.		
w020	No gitignore	There should be a gitignore file here: ‘{gitignore_path}’. No gitignore means large amounts of unimportant files may be accidentally shared or added to the project.		
w021	Suite file in $CMCCONST	The realpath for file ‘{path}’ is in the $CMCCONST folder ‘{cmcconst}’. Task, config, flow, and resource XML files used in a suite should not be in the $CMCCONST folder.	https://gitlab.science.gc.ca/CMOI/best-practices/blob/master/en/constants.md	
b013	Unclear folder name	The folder ‘{unclear}’ should have a descriptive soft link next to it. For example ‘forecast -> e1’. This gives newbies one less thing to memorize when getting started.	https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Obfuscation	
b014	Bad node name	Bad node name ‘{node_name}’ in flow XML ‘{flow_path}’. This name works, but the recommendation is to match this regex: {regex}	https://regex101.com/	
e017	Duplicate name in flow container	The container ‘{container_name}’ in a flow XML has more than one element with the name or subname ‘{duplicate_name}’. All direct children in a container must have a unique name or subname.		
e018	Submits element has name attribute	All SUBMITS elements should have a ‘sub_name’ attribute not a ‘name’ attribute. The file ‘{file_path}’ contains: ‘{matching_string}’		
e019	Non-submits element has sub_name attribute	Only SUBMITS elements should have a ‘sub_name’ attribute. You may need to use the ‘name’ attribute instead. The file ‘{file_path}’ contains: ‘{matching_string}’
