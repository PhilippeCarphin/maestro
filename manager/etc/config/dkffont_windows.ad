! Windows-specific "application" defaults...

! Only one default option on the Windows platform - the initial font.
! This is becuase the font family Helvetica is not usually installed,
! so we must substitute something else; the commonest alternative for
! people with the Win32 interface is Arial, so we go with that...

*DKFChooseFont.initialFont:	Arial 12 bold
