## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.
* When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://gitlab.science.gc.ca/CMOI/maestro/issues) and [merge requests](https://gitlab.science.gc.ca/CMOI/maestro/merge_requests) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a merge request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
