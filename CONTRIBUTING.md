# Contributing to Maestro

Thanks for checking out Maestro! We've put together the following guidelines to help you figure out where you can best be helpful. Interested in making a contribution? Read on!

## Guidelines

1. If you open a  [merge requests](https://gitlab.science.gc.ca/CMOI/maestro/merge_requests), please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.
1. When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. A simple feature written for just one person still adds complexity to the project.
1. Always seek code review from at least one other developer before merging your changes. [Here's a short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AT7JxqoIps&list=PLRf-PfhVvwFA7tGxwEgxgnJIY7aVevqqo) about how you might share your work for a code review and merge.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://gitlab.science.gc.ca/CMOI/maestro/issues) and [merge requests](https://gitlab.science.gc.ca/CMOI/maestro/merge_requests) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a [merge request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AT7JxqoIps&list=PLRf-PfhVvwFA7tGxwEgxgnJIY7aVevqqo).
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
